; fau: customSettings - local customizations of the ILIAS user interface
;
; This file is read by class.ilCustomize.php
; Settings can be used with ilCust->getSetting("setting")
;
; Some dynamic settings are based on dynamic criteria (e.g. role dependent).
; All other settings are looked up in the following ini files:
;
; 0. [admin] section in Customizing/customize.ini.php if administration is visible
; 1. [norep] section in Customizing/customize.ini.php if repository is not visible
; 2. [user skin] section in Customizing/customize.ini.php
; 3. [customize] section in data/<client>/client.ini.php
; 4. [customize] section in ilias.ini.php
; 5. [default]   section in Customizing/customize.ini.php
;
; The current skin's section corresponds to the directory name of the skin.
; The client and ilias settings can differ between a development
; and a production installation of ILIAS.
;
; Each non-dynamic setting should have at least a definition
; in the default section of customize.ini.php (last lookup).
; The default setting should correspond to a non-customized ILIAS.
;
; Settings should have positive naming similar to:
; <module>_<show|enable|with>_<element> = "0|1"
;
; Dynamic settings:
; repository_is_visible				;true if repository is visible
; administration_is_visible			;true if administration is visible


[default]
; settings to be changed per client in client.ini.php
