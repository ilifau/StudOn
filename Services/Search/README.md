## Media Objects and Content Snippets

Content Snippets and Media Objects are only found when using Lucene
search, and not direct search. They are displayed as sub-objects of
Media Pools. This is also the case in the 'Advanced Search', except
when searching via the 'Content' field: there Content Snippets and
Media Objects are also included in the direct search.
